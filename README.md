## Motivation

Each member of our team had been in a situation where hours had been spent debating with their significant other or friends over what to watch and what to eat. We set out to create a solution to end those painful hours scrolling through Netflix or Google maps. Rather than using an API based on recipes, it was important to our team that Deto No Yoru would be an easy date night fix by using local restaurants.  By generating a random restaurant and anime, our goal was to take the “thinking” out of date night planning.
